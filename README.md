Idea : accessible toorism
problem: It's been a great challenge for the people with visual impairment to manage their travel and trips. Whenever they have to travel, they rely on the domestic help and seek support from random people nearby. It's always not an ideal solution to depend on due to many reasons like:
·        It’s not guaranteed that people will be always available to help in all places and that too with their willingness.
·        It becomes a matter of privacy and safety. Specially for women.
·        random people may offer support to a certain extent but it’s not necessary that they would cooperate completely upto the destination place.
 
Solution: We have designed an application, “TRAVEL ASSIST”, which would act as an uber to connect the VI travellers and employed volunteers. 
Once the traveller requests for help, app will send the notification to all available volunteers and the very first volunteer, who accepts the request, will be assigned to the traveller. This way, volunteers will be assigned and will be paid the charges or token of appreciation depending upon the time that they would spend.
For this, app will register each user either as volunteer or traveller with their verified details. 
Through this app, users will also be able to fix their multiple days trip with the volunteers. This is very supportive to those who plan to visit the Malls, hilstations or beaches.
